    share some file or resources through computer then the virus move throuth the shared file . 
    Once active, it can replicate into other files, corrupt data, display unwanted messages, 
    or even delete information. Computer virus is very first to spread.

    Warm virus standalone that does not need to attach to another file.It spreads 
    automatically across networks by exploiting security holes—no human action required 
    after the first infection.Worms often slow networks or devices by rapidly replicating
